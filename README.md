# Neuro Nexus 2019
This project is for the Neuro Nexus 2019 competition. Projects are invited from neuroscientists, clinicians, and mental health professionals. 120-150 participants, from a multitude of backgrounds, will then come together in teams of 5-7 individuals to work on the projects proposed over a period of 6 weeks. The program will culminate in a 72-hour hackathon weekend where access to prototyping resources are provided, and at Demo Night teams will showcase their projects to the community at large.

## Problem:
Many neuroimaging techniques (like functional MRI) need to factor out spurious signals coming from tissues in the brain that are of no interest. For example, signals coming from the cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) may include information about pulse/heart rate that we are not really interested in but nonetheless contaminate the signal from the grey matter (that we are interested in). So accurate tissue masks allow us to isolate these spurious signals so we can exclude them from our models.
