# Neuro Nexus 2019
This project is for the Neuro Nexus 2019 competition. Projects are invited from neuroscientists, clinicians, and mental health professionals. 120-150 participants, from a multitude of backgrounds, will then come together in teams of 5-7 individuals to work on the projects proposed over a period of 6 weeks. The program will culminate in a 72-hour hackathon weekend where access to prototyping resources are provided, and at Demo Night teams will showcase their projects to the community at large.

## Problem:
Our team Braining Edge, was tasked with creating a new algorithm to segment the human brain. Previous techniques used a set of probabilities chosen by the algorithm designer to guess which pixel belonged to a certain tissue type. Only problem with this approach is that there are many possible ways a tissue type appears on the MRI. This means means the algorithm designer must account for almost every single combination and as you can probably guess, previous techniques did not work too well.

## Solution:
We at Braining Edge have improved on these algorithms by using Deep Learning for this task. Instead of telling the program what each tissue should look like, what if it could learn for itself? Over the past 6-weeks, reading through countless research papers and adding our own flavour to the algorithm we were able to come up with a working software that outperformed all classical methods.
